## My process

-   Started by outlining the HTML structure

-   Added hover styles later

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that img doesn't work with pseudo elements like ::after and ::before.

I learned how to create overlay on an image. In addition, learned about absolute positioning and how to center things with absolute position.

Some cool css that I learned.

```css
.coin__profile-overlay__eye {
    display: none;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    z-index: 2;
}
```
